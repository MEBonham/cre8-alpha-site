                    <h2>Why CRE8?</h2>
                    <p>There are a lot of RPGs on the market; even a lot of free ones. And it takes time to learn a new RPG, if you're going to actually play it right. So why spend your time learning CRE8?</p>
                    <p>What kind of RPG is CRE8? It's a sword-and-sorcery genre, rules-heavy, narrativist-light RPG. In other words, it's competing directly with Dungeons & Dragons, the mammoth leader of the RPG market. But there are things that it does better than Dungeons & Dragons! And those are the reasons you should learn it.</p>
                    <p>I'll try to describe CRE8's strengths in eight parts, to go with its name (which stands for "Codex of Roleplaying: Epic Eight").</p>
                    <h3>1. Roll What's On Your Character Sheet</h3>
                    <p>With few exceptions, when you roll dice in CRE8, the number you add is some number written on your character sheet. No temporary "+2 bonus to this skill check" special conditions. Instead, the system influences die rolls through various Dice Mechanics. Admittedly, D&D has gotten <em>much</em> better about this in 5th Edition. So this alone isn't a reason to switch, 5e players.</p>
                    <h3>2. Make Your Own Class</h3>
                    <p>You choose your special abilities, rather than them being told what abilities you receive by your Class. That makes character creation much more modular and under the player's control than in D&D, even when D&D allows multiclassing.</p>
                    <h3>3. Eight Levels of Normal Progression</h3>
                    <p>Rather than twenty, normal character progression happens for merely eight levels. That makes leveling up more exciting, albeit rarer, and keeps bonuses to die rolls within sane limits. Again, sane die bonuses is something that D&D has gotten <em>much</em> better at in 5th Edition, with its "Bounded Accuracy." But CRE8 does the "Bounded Accuracy" thing better, largely due to its basic 3d20 die mechanic.</p>
                    <h3>4. Dynamic Combat Attacks</h3>
                    <p>The defender always rolls a saving throw, rather than an attacker making an attack roll. That makes combat more exciting. And getting Wounded means damage can actually matter before you get to zero Vitality Points. And attacks can do other things besides just damage, too&mdash;the cave troll can knock Gimli across the room without needing a special ability to do so.</p>
                    <h3>5. Non-Vancian Magic</h3>
                    <p>"Vancian Magic" is a sacred cow of D&D. CRE8 steers away from it. Instead you have a "noun-verb" system of crafting your own spells by applying different Seeds to different Spells. And you decide how many Magic Points to spend on a spell in order to get enough effect out of it. And your magical might recharges every short rest, which largely eliminates "the fifteen minute workday" effect that tends to happen in D&D. Spellcasters have the same process of keeping up their Reserve Points as other characters.</p>
                    <h3>6. Magic Items Are Special</h3>
                    <p>D&D characters used to get bogged down with so many minor magic items, it was called "the Christmas Tree effect." And even in 5e, where things have improved, you largely get some merchant to craft your important magic items for you, rather than finding legendary items in a long-lost dungeon. In CRE8, you're more functional with no magic items at all, and they grow in power with you as you increase in level&mdash;so you don't have to "upgrade" at the store as you level up, and your items can be more involved in the story.</p>
                    <h3>7. No Ability Scores</h3>
                    <p>5th Edition D&D is more tied than ever to the six ability scores Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma. But a lot of things don't make sense about those ability scores if you start thinking too much about them. CRE8 makes the stylistic choice of steering clear of Ability Scores at all ... so there's never a question of which ability score your Skills, for example, should be based on.</p>
                    <h3>8. Lots More to Discover</h3>
                    <p>Tired of keeping track of every copper piece you come across? Try out CRE8's abstracted Wealth system. In general, CRE8 tries to make things as streamlined as possible without losing verisimilitude, and it's not afraid to make hamburger out of D&D's sacred cows.</p>
