                    <h2>Call Ally</h2>
                    <h3>[Core] [Spell] Feat</h3>
                    <h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
                    <p>Caster Level 2; applicable seed.</p>
                    <h5>Action: Standard</h5>
                    <h5>Base MP Cost: 2 MP</h5>
                    <h5>Seeds:</h5>
                    <p>Air, Animal, Cold, Earth, Fire, Lightning, Mind, Plant, Radiant, Shadow, Water</p>
                    <h5>Range:</h5>
                    <p>Within your fray.</p>
                    <h5>Duration:</h5>
                    <p>Encounter</p>
                    <h5>Base Effect:</h5>
                    <p>Create a Level 1 <a href="../../Bestiary/Stooges.html">stooge</a> within range as a [Conjuration] effect. This stooge will consider you an ally.</p>
                    <p>If you can communicate with the stooge and spend actions to direct it, it will generally cooperate. Otherwise, it will act on its own initiative, as controlled by the GM, which likely involves doing little unless its self-preservation is threatened.</p>
                    <p>You can only have one stooge at a time.</p>
                    <h5>Augment:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>MP +1 (cumulative):</strong> Increase the Level of the stooge by 1, to a maximum of 9. (Find base statistics on the <a href="../../Bestiary/Stooges.html">stooge table</a>.)</li>
                        <li><strong>MP +1:</strong> Increase range to anywhere within your sector.</li>
                        <li><strong>MP +2:</strong> Increase range to anywhere within adjacent sectors.</li>
                        <li><strong>MP +2:</strong> Conjure a Swarm of stooges instead of a single stooge.</li>
                        <li><strong>MP +2:</strong> The stooge can automatically understand you.</li>
                        <li><strong>MP +3:</strong> Increase range to line of sight.</li>
                        <li><strong>MP +4:</strong> The stooge has its own full set of actions, immediately <em>before</em> you in the initiative order, and can be directed as a free action.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Seed Effects:</h5>

                        <li><strong>Mind:</strong> The stooge understands you telepathically. It is a construct, with Hit Points rather than Vitality Points.</li>
