                    <h2>RPG Basics</h2>
                    <h3>Group Storytelling</h3>
                    <p>At its heart, an RPG is a group storytelling activity. Players start with a setting and some characters, and then they take turns contributing to what happens next. The goal is to make the ensuing story fun, memorable, and maybe even epic. Generally, this involves the protagonists going on dangerous adventures and having the opportunity to accomplish heroic deeds.</p>
                    <h4 id="pc">Players and PCs</h4>
                    <p>Each of the story's main protagonists is generally controlled by one of the game's players, and is therefore called a "Player Character" or <strong>PC</strong>.</p>
                    <h4 id="gm">The Game Master</h4>
                    <p>One of the participants in an RPG is designated the "Game Master" or <strong>GM</strong>. The GM plans, controls, and acts out the story's setting and characters, except for the PCs. This means the GM has a lot of responsibility to make sure that the seeds of an exciting plot are available to the other players, and to try to make sure everyone has fun. But leading a memorable game as a GM can also be very fun and satisfying.</p>
                    <h4>Role of the Dice</h4>
                    <p>When someone tries to do something difficult or risky, dice are used to determine the outcome. This helps to keep the game somewhat fair and less predictable.</p>
                    <h4>Role-Playing</h4>
                    <p>It's called a "Role-Playing" game because you don't just state what a character does or what happens in the story, you act it out, at least a little bit. You think about what your character would do in a situation, not necessarily what you yourself would do. You speak as your character, sometimes. This makes the game even more of a creative outlet.</p>
                    <h3>Diversity of Play</h3>
                    <p>People play RPGs in a lot of different ways. Sometimes the campaign setting is something the GM has come up with herself; sometimes it is borrowed from an external source, such as a published setting, a series of novels, or a friend's ideas.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the PCs are confronted with an obvious adventure in order to accomplish obvious goals (like "survive" or "save the world"). Sometimes, the GM creates this adventure; sometimes it is guided by a published adventure (also known as a "module"). Other times, the PCs are allowed to basically follow their individual motivations and figure out what adventure they want to have. (This is sometimes known as "sandbox-style play.")</p>
                    <p>Some players or groups enjoy RPGs because of the opportunity to act out different roles and interactions. They tend to emphasize detailed backstories and motivations for the PCs, as well as in-character dialogue. It can create exceptional drama when a player decides that her PC will do something terribly foolish because "it's what my character would do."</p>
                    <p>Other players or groups enjoy RPGs because of their strategic aspects. They tend to emphasize lots of lethal action (combat), and sometimes careful selection of characters' abilities in order to make them as powerful as possible. (This is sometimes known as "optimization.")</p>
                    <p>Still other players or groups enjoy RPGs because of the opportunity to "think outside the box" and creatively bend the game's rules. They tend to focus on puzzle-like challenges in the story, as well as the GM allowing the players to dictate minor aspects of the campaign setting. (For example, "Since this is an old part of town, can my character find a support beam in the basement that has rotted with termites and might be used to collapse the ceiling with a bit of work?" "Yeah, definitely." This type of addition to the story is sometimes called a "narrativist element," because it allows the player to share in the GM's role as the story's narrator.)</p>
                    <p>This great variety in RPGs is a strength, but it can also be a challenge. Try to find a group dynamic that allows everyone to be happy with the game's emphases.</p>
                    <h3>More About Dice</h3>
                    <p>A standard set of polyhedral RPG dice includes the following varieties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Four-sided tetrahedral dice, known as <strong>d4</strong>'s.</li>
                        <li>Six-sided cube-shaped dice, known as <strong>d6</strong>'s.</li>
                        <li>Eight-sided octahedral dice, known as <strong>d8</strong>'s.</li>
                        <li>Ten-sided dice, known as <strong>d10</strong>'s. It is standard for a d10 to have a '0' on one side, even though that side actually indicates a result of 10.</li>
                        <li>Twelve-sided dodecahedral dice, known as <strong>d12</strong>'s.</li>
                        <li>Twenty-sided icosahedral dice, known as <strong>d20</strong>'s. These are acutally used the most in many game systems, including CRE8.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 id="nds">NdS Notation</h4>
                    <p>RPG rules will often instruct you to roll two numbers with a 'd' in between them, such as "roll 3d8." This means that you roll a number of dice equal to the first number, each with a number of sides equal to the second number. For example, 3d8 would mean to roll three 8-sided dice and (usually) add their results together to get a total result.</p>
                    <h4>d% or d100</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes RPG rules will instruct you to roll d% or d100. (This is rare in CRE8.) If you do not have access to a 100-sided die (a specialty item), you can get the same results by rolling two different d10s; your final result gets its tens'-place digit from one die, and its ones'-place digit from the other die. (Most dice sets come with a d10 already marked with '10', '20', '30', etc., to facilitate this very thing.) When rolling d%, do not treat a '0' as a '10', unless you get a result of '0' (or '00') on both dice, indicating a final result of 100.</p>
                    <h4 id="tn">Target Number (TN)</h4>
                    <p>Most often, when you roll dice, there is some particular result you are hoping to get. In CRE8, this is called the TN ("Target Number"), and you are hoping to get <em>at least</em> that result on your die roll, after you have applied any modifiers. If your total die result meets or exceeds the TN, you succeed on whatever roll you were attempting. If your total result is less than the TN, that's a failure!</p>
